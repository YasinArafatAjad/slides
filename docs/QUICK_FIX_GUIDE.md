## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. **Start the server:**
```bash
npm run server
```

2. **Check if it's working:**

curl http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/realtime
```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators:
```
🔍 Environment Validation:

```

### ❌ Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue 1: "Missing required environment variables"**
```
Solution: Check your .env file has all required variables
```

**Issue 2: "PERMISSION_DENIED"**
```
Solution: Add service account email to GA4 property with Viewer access
```

**Issue 3: "API_KEY_INVALID"**
```
Solution: Enable Google Analytics Data API in Google Cloud Console
```

**Issue 4: "Property not found"**
```
Solution: Check GA4_PROPERTY_ID is the correct numeric value
```

## 🌐 Available Endpoints

After starting the server, these endpoints will be available:

- `GET /api/health` - Server health and GA4 connection status
- `GET /api/analytics/realtime` - Real-time active users
- `GET /api/analytics/visitors?range=7d` - Visitor trends
- `GET /api/analytics/pageviews?range=7d` - Page views data
- `GET /api/analytics/devices?range=7d` - Device breakdown
- `GET /api/analytics/traffic-sources?range=7d` - Traffic sources
- `GET /api/analytics/metrics?range=7d` - Key metrics

## 🚨 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the server logs** - they now provide detailed error information
2. **Verify your .env file** - make sure all variables are set
3. **Test the health endpoint** - it shows exactly what's wrong
4. **Enable the correct API** - Google Analytics Data API (not Reporting API)

## 📊 Fallback Mode

If GA4 isn't connected, the server will:
- ✅ Still work with demo data
- ✅ Show clear status in health check
- ✅ Provide helpful error messages
- ✅ Allow you to test the frontend

The analytics dashboard will work either way!
